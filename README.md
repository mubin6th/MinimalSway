## About
MinimalSway is a configuration or *a list of settings* for the SwayWM.
It makes the window manager visually appealing. The configuration
helps people not to focus on customizing there desktops instead to
focus on their work. MinimalSway is a "minimal" configuration around
SwayWM. The aim is to write as little configuration as possible while
making it look nice.


By defualt, MinimalSway has some settings that may not fit peoples
need. Therefore, itself is also customizable to some extent. The
customizability helps users to configure it according to their
hardware, screens and preference.


Though the name is "MinimalSway", it also works with Swayfx as it is
a *superset* of SwayWM.
